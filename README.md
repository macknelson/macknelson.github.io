## My portfolio

This is my portfolio site, hosting all of the work I wish to share with potential employers. I have used this site as a way to get used to the Git workflow and GitHub interface. I'm liking it so far, now that I (finally) know how to use it!

I'll update this repo every time I make a change, then push it to a DigitalOcean droplet where it will finally be deployed on macknelsonmedia.com. Thanks for taking a look!

In this repo, we have a few files of importance:

Our **[index.html](https://github.com/macknelson/macknelsonmedia.com/blob/master/main.d8e0d294.css)** file. This is the only page on the site, and it hosts all relevant code to display the HTML that you will see upon visiting the site.

Our **[main.d8e0d294.css](https://github.com/macknelson/macknelsonmedia.com/blob/master/main.d8e0d294.css)** file. This connects to the index.html file previously mentioned and adds the CSS changes.

Our **[main.bc58148c.js](https://github.com/macknelson/macknelsonmedia.com/blob/master/main.bc58148c.js)** file. This connects to the index.html file and adds any JavaScript running on the site.

Our **[assets](https://github.com/macknelson/macknelsonmedia.com/tree/master/assets)** folder, which hosts all of the images and the favicon for the site.
